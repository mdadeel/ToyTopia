# 🧸 ToyTopia

Hi! Welcome to **ToyTopia**! This is a simple website for buying used toys in Bangladesh. I made this project to learn React and Firebase.

## 👋 About Me
I am a junior developer learning web development. This is one of my first big projects! I used React because it's popular and fun. I tried my best to make the code clean, but sorry if it looks a bit messy sometimes! 😅

## 🚀 How to Run It
If you want to run this project on your computer, just follow these steps:

1.  **Download user files**: Clone this repo or download the zip.
2.  **Install stuff**: Open terminal and type:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    (This installs all the packages I used)
3.  **Setup Firebase**:
    - You need a file called `.env` in the main folder.
    - Ask me for the keys or copy `.env.example` and put your own keys there!
4.  **Start the server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
5.  Open `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever link it shows) in your browser.

## 🛠️ Tech I Used
-   **React**: For building the UI components.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: For styling (I love utility classes!).
-   **Firebase**: For login (Google/Email) and database stuff.
-   **React Router**: To move between pages.
-   **Swiper**: For the cool sliders.

## ✨ Features
-   Login with Google or Email (Firebase auth is cool!)
-   See lots of toys
-   Search for toys
-   See details (price, rating, description)
-   Mobile friendly (I think/hope)

## 🐛 Bugs?
If you find bugs, please tell me! safely ignore console warnings if you see any hehe.
