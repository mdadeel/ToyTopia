Once a user is logged in, user information will show on the navbar even if he/she reloads the website, this info will not disappear. You can show a loader when the logged-in user info is in a loading state.  You can implement this using Firebase's onAuthStateChange method. 
Challenges 
My Profile: Create a protected route where, after logging in, users can see their information like- name, email, and photoURL and there will be a form with 2 input fields for name and photoURL. Users can edit the name and photoURL and save the changes. This "saving" process uses Firebase's updateProfile() method to update the user's information stored securely in Firebase. 
Implement show and hide passwords on the registration page. By default, it won’t show the password, but when you click on the “Eye” icon, it will. In this way, you need to toggle.

On clicking the reset button. Redirect the user to Gmail.
